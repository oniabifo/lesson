Changes to Note: 
```
Give the ec2 instance a name you like
Also create a new key pair and call it a name. This key pair will be used to connect to the ec2 instance from your local server
```

Once the ec2 instance has been succesfully launched, You will ssh into the instance using a command like this

# CONNECTING TO AN EC2 INSTANCE FROM LOCAL
_ssh -i abi2.pem ubuntu@public-ip-address_

If the connection is successful, It should look like the screenshot below
