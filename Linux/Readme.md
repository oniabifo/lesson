## Unit 3 README: Terminal and Bash

### Unit Description

In this unit, we will gain technical hands-on experience by using bash and the command line. Learning the command line can be a challenging adjustment, but it is an absolutely vital skill for IT and Cybersecurity professionals. 

- We will begin with basic file navigation and retrieval. Then, we'll expand into file searching, combining commands, and adding command options. Then we will  use text processing and text editing to develop a custom command-line script.

### Lab Environment

You will use your local Vagrant virtual machine for today's activities.

- Student access: You will log into the Ubuntu ec2 instance that was created on aws with your username and password

### What to Be Aware Of:

- Your Ubuntu EC2 Instance should be set-up before Day 1. 

- Practice makes perfect! This is the first technical, hands-on unit of the course and it can take some hard work to adjust to. Take the time you need to practice getting used to working on the command line.
