## Activity File: Finding your Milky Way 
 
- You will continue in your role as security analyst at Gilbratar Corp, investigating the employee potentially selling secret recipes to Ole Corp.

- Your manager at Gilbratar Corp needs you to create an additional directory, as they believe there is a second employee working with Ole Corp.

- You also must copy and move several of the evidence files after creating this new directory.

### Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the `/Documents/` folder in your Ubuntu VM:

  1. Create an additional folder called `_Internal_Investigation_Emp_2`.

  2. Using absolute paths, move the file `fraud_email_evidence` from `_Internal_Investigation_Emp_1` to `_Internal_Investigation_Emp_2` as you have been told there will not be email evidence for the first employee. 

  3. Using absolute paths, copy the file `call_log_evidence` from `_Internal_Investigation_Emp_1` to `_Internal_Investigation_Emp_2`, as you have been told there will likely be log evidence from both employees.

  4. Check your directories to confirm the files are all in the correct locations.
