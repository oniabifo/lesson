## Activity File: Take Five and Practice the Command Line

- You are playing the role of a security analyst at Gilbratar Corp. 

- Gilbratar Corp believes one of their employees might be selling secret recipes to Ole Corp.

- You have been tasked with creating evidence files for email, logs, and web access.  

- These files are currently empty, but will be used later to organize your investigation notes on the employee.

### Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the `/Documents/` folder in your Ubuntu VM:

  1. Create a folder called `Internal_Investigation`.

  2. Navigate into the `Internal_Investigation` folder.

  3. From within the `Internal_Investigation` folder, print the working directory to confirm you are in the correct place.

  4. Create three files inside the `Internal_Investigation` folder:
      * `fraud_email_evidence`
      * `call_log_evidence`
      * `surf_web_evidence`
  5. Delete the file called `surf_web_evidence` as you realized Gilbratar has no web logs captured.
  6. Display (list) all the files created.
  7. Clear the terminal window.

**Hint:** Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're having trouble with a command.
